# Pokédex

## The Challenge

Since the 90s Pokémon enjoy worldwide popularity. These little monsters are not only cute but led to many games and phenomena like Pokémon Go.

As more than 1100 Pokemon’s exist it’s very hard to have a clear understanding or even overview about each. Therefore we’d like to provide a solution that lets user discover and browse through all Pokemon’s.

As an example, you can view this website: <br> https://pokedex-phi-ten.vercel.app/

## The API

Before getting started with the Frontend we have to make sure that sufficient data is accessible. Please use this API for the whole application: https://pokeapi.co

## The Application

The application should provide us basic browsing and discovering features. It’s all about the function. Design is not the highest priority in this part.

## List All Pokemons

Please list all Pokemon with a short summary of each on the root page of the application. Display at least the image of the Pokemon and its name.

## Show Details of a Pokemon

When a user clicks on a Pokemon we’d like to display the sufficient details of each Pokemon. Please list next to name and image at least the following attributes:

- Species
- Stats
- Types
- Weight
- Moves

## Pagination

Listing all Pokemon on a single page is not that sufficient. Overall i‘d be a whole bunch of data and information. Please add some pagination and make sure that we display at a maximum 16 Pokemon at once.

## Optional – Text Search

You maybe know those moments when you remember the name of a Pokemon or at least parts of it. Please add a search field on the main page that enables the user to search for the name of a Pokemon. The search should only begin to process when the minimum of three characters are given. The search results are displayed in the main list.

## Target Technology

Please use the regular HTML and Javascript for your solution. In terms of additional tools and libraries, you can use your preferred technologies. We don‘t even make any assumptions about CSS handling. You can however choose to use any frontend framework of choice for this project; React js, Next js etc.
